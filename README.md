INSTRUCTIONS : Accessible web sites allow anyone and everyone to use the web, regardless of physical or hardware differences. They also, generally, make sites faster to download and easier to parse for software like search engines. More accessible web sites are also starting to be given higher PageRank scores for web searches.
